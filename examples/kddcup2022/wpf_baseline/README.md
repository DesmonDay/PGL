# Introduction
Wind Power Forecasting (WPF) aims to accurately estimate the wind power supply of a wind farm at different time scales. 
Wind power is one of the most installed renewable energy resources in the world, and the accuracy of wind power forecasting method directly affects dispatching and operation safety of the power grid.
WPF has been widely recognized as one of the most critical issues in wind power integration and operation.
