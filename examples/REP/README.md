# Relation-based Embedding Propagation

Here we provide the code of our paper ***Simple and Effective Relation-based Embedding Propagation for Knowledge Representation Learning***.

## Overview

REP is a simple and effective embedding propagation method for knowledge representation learning by utilizing graph context in KGs. The key idea is to incorporate relational graph structure information into pre-trained triplet-based embeddings. Experimental results show that by enriching pre-trained triplet-based embeddings
with graph context, REP can improve or maintain prediction quality with less time cost.
